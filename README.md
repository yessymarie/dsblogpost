## Project Purpose <a name="purpose"></a>
In this project, I was intended to use Stack Overflow 2020 Survey to understand about:
1. What is the age range trend of coders?
2. What is the most used programming language in an age range?
3. How is the correlation between 1st age code in a country based on its age range?
