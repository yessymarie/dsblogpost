## Installation <a name="installation"></a>
For the libraries you need Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn from Python libraries. The code can run using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Purpose <a name="purpose"></a>
In this project, I was intended to use Stack Overflow 2020 Survey to understand about:
1. What is the age range trend of coders?
2. What is the most used programming language in an age range?
3. How is the correlation between 1st age code in a country based on its age range?
It is a simple script to make a demography of coders based on its age and country from Stack Overflow 2020 survey. It shows the statistic based on age and country.

To use this code, you have to install python. Python's Libraries:
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
