## Installation <a name="installation"></a>
For the libraries you need Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn from Python libraries. The code can run using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Purpose <a name="purpose"></a>
In this project, I was intended to use Stack Overflow 2020 Survey to understand about:
1. What is the age range trend of coders?
2. What is the most used programming language in an age range?
3. How is the correlation between 1st age code in a country based on its age range?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are 3 notebooks available here to showcase work related to the above questions.  Each of the notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title.  Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  

There is an additional `.py` file that runs the necessary code to obtain the final model used to predict salary.
